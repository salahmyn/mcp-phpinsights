<?php
// phpinsights.php
return [
    'preset' => 'laravel', // or 'symfony', 'magento2', 'drupal', 'default'
    'ide' => 'vscode',     // for better IDE integration
    'exclude' => [
        'vendor',
        'storage',
        'bootstrap/cache',
        'node_modules',
        'tests',           // exclude test files if desired
    ],
    'config' => [
        // Customize specific rules
        \NunoMaduro\PhpInsights\Domain\Insights\CyclomaticComplexityIsHigh::class => [
            'maxComplexity' => 10, // Allow higher complexity
        ],
    ],
];
```

### Advanced MCP Configuration

For more control, you can configure the MCP server with custom settings:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "phpinsights": {
      "command": "mcp-phpinsights",
      "args": [],
      "env": {
        "PHPINSIGHTS_TIMEOUT": "300000",  // 5 minutes

      }
    }
  }
}
```

## üéØ Real-World Examples

### Example 1: Laravel Project Analysis

**Prompt in Cursor:**

```
"Analyze my Laravel project and tell me what needs improvement"
```

**Claude's Response:**

```
I'll analyze your Laravel project for code quality issues...

üìä Analysis Results:
- Overall Score: 78/100
- Code Quality: 85%
- Architecture: 80%
- Style: 75%
- Complexity: 70%

üö® Priority Issues:
1. app/Http/Controllers/UserController.php:45 - Method too long (25 lines)
2. app/Models/Product.php:12 - Missing return type declaration
3. resources/views/users/index.blade.php:8 - Unused variable $temp

üí° Recommendations:
- Break down the long controller method into smaller functions
- Add proper type hints to model methods
- Remove unused variables in Blade templates

Would you like me to help fix any of these issues?
```

### Example 2: Automated Code Fixes

**Prompt in Cursor:**

```
"Fix all the style issues in my src/ directory"
```

**Claude's Response:**

```
I'll run PHP Insights with automatic fixes on your src/ directory...

üîß Fixing Issues:
‚úÖ Fixed 12 PSR-12 style violations
‚úÖ Removed 3 unused imports
‚úÖ Fixed 5 missing type declarations
‚úÖ Corrected 2 indentation issues

üìà Results:
- Before: 75% style score
- After: 92% style score

The fixes have been applied automatically. Your code now follows PSR-12 standards!
```

### Example 3: Focused Analysis

**Prompt in Cursor:**

```
"Analyze only the app/Models directory and show me the complexity issues"
```

**Claude's Response:**

```
I'll analyze the Models directory for complexity issues...

üìÅ Analyzing: app/Models/
üîç Found 3 complexity issues:

1. User.php:45 - calculateUserScore() method
   - Complexity: 12 (recommended: ‚â§10)
   - Issues: Multiple nested conditions
   - Suggestion: Extract validation logic to separate methods

2. Product.php:78 - processOrder() method  
   - Complexity: 15 (recommended: ‚â§10)
   - Issues: Long switch statement
   - Suggestion: Use strategy pattern or extract to service class

3. Order.php:123 - validateOrderData() method
   - Complexity: 11 (recommended: ‚â§10)
   - Issues: Multiple validation rules in one method
   - Suggestion: Split into individual validation methods

Would you like me to help refactor any of these methods?
```

## üö® Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"PHP Insights not found"**

```bash
# Make sure PHP Insights is installed
composer require nunomaduro/phpinsights --dev

# Verify installation
./vendor/bin/phpinsights --version
```

**"Permission denied"**

```bash
# Fix permissions
chmod +x vendor/bin/phpinsights
```

**"Timeout errors"**

- Increase timeout in MCP configuration
- Analyze smaller directories at a time
- Check if PHP Insights is properly configured

**"No issues found"**

- Verify your project has PHP files
- Check if directories are excluded in phpinsights.php
- Ensure PHP Insights can access your files

### Debug Mode

Enable debug logging to troubleshoot issues:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "phpinsights": {
      "command": "mcp-phpinsights",
      "args": [],
      "env": {
        "DEBUG": "mcp-phpinsights:*"
      }
    }
  }
}
```
